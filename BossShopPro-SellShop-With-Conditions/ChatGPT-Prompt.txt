===================
NOTE:
I did have to discuss with ChatGPT a bit to get this to output properly. And I had to make a couple edits to the Python code.
===================
I'm making a Minecraft server economy. Generate a Python script that will generate the proper formatting for my Sell Shop of my Minecraft server economy using BossShopPro (a spigotmc plugin). 

I will provide you with a list of Minecraft item names in the format 'Item Name' with Item Worth of the relevant item to the right of it on the same line.

Item List:
Wheat Seeds	11.09
Wheat	20.05
Carrot	28.16
Potato	28.16
Sugar Cane	19.80
Pumpkin	22.30
Melon	23.75
Cactus	20.74
Brown Mushroom	42.23
Red Mushroom	16.21
Beetroot	28.16
Cake	12.00
Pumpkin Pie	50.00
Cookie	13.07
Honey Bottle	4.00
Cooked Cod	8.53
Cooked Salmon	23.47
Pufferfish	42.67
Tropical Fish	36.27
Kelp	11.00

Please convert those items and prices to be within the following BossShopPro config format.

Desired Format:
  Item_Name:
    MenuItem:
    - type:Item_Name
    - amount:1
    - name:&aSell Item Name
    - 'lore1:&7Amount: &a2304'
    - 'lore2:&7Sell For: &aITEM_WORTH Resource Points'
    - 'lore3:&7Cooldown: &a1 Hour'
    PriceType: item
    Price:
    - - type:Item_Name
      - amount:2304
    RewardType: COMMAND
    Reward:
    - k admin resourcepoints %kingdoms_name% add ITEM_WORTH
    - lp user %player% permission settemp bsp.sellshop.cooldown.Item_Name true 1h
    Message: '&aYou just sold 1 inventory of Item_Name for %price% RP.'
    Condition:
    - type:permission
    - dontmatch:bsp.sellshop.cooldown.Item_Name 
    ExtraPermission: ''
  # Continue this pattern for other items

Things to Replace:
1. Every mention of "Item_Name" should be replaced with the relevant item name (e.g. "Wheat_Seeds").
2. Where it says "name:&aSell Item Name" replace the "Item Name" portion with the relevant item name but instead of having an underscore (if relevant) it will have a space.
3. Replace every mention of ITEM_WORTH with the relevant item's item worth (AKA the number to the right of it in the provided item list). However, first round the number to the nearest whole number.
4. For both sections that mention "- amount:" and then a number- leave it alone! I do not want them modified!! Let me repeat- leave them untouched! Amount and rewards are SEPARATE. 
5. For the line stating "'lore1:&7Amount: &a2304'" leave the amount alone. I want it to be 2304 there. Do not touch it.

Double check your code for all types of errors before providing it to me.
