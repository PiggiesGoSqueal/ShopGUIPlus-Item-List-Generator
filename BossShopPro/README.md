Title: Minecraft Server Economy Configuration Generator

Description:

This Python script, created by ChatGPT, generates a configuration format for Minecraft server economy using the BossShopPro plugin. It takes a list of Minecraft item names and their corresponding prices and transforms them into the required format for your server's economy setup.

Usage:

    Define your list of Minecraft item names and their prices in the item_list array.

    The script automatically converts item names with spaces into uppercase versions without spaces, which are used as identifiers in the configuration.

    The prices are rounded to the nearest whole number.

    The script generates the desired configuration structure for each item, including item type, name, lore, price, and rewards.

    The output can be copied directly from the script's execution and pasted into your BossShopPro configuration file.
	
	By default the reward is using points but you may change it to money instead.
	
	If you wish to further configure the results copy/paste the ChatGPT prompt file contents into ChatGPT yourself.
	
	Note this description was generated by ChatGPT mostly.
